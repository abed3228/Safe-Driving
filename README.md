 <h3><b>Project Objective:</b></h3>
A system for alcohol level testing in vehicles before ignition. If the alcohol level is higher than allowed, the system will not allow the driver to start the vehicle. Additionally, the system sends an SMS message to a predefined backup phone number with the vehicle's location (GPS). Otherwise, the vehicle can be started.
<h3><b>Current Market Status:</b></h3> 
There is no similar product available in the market.
 <h3><b>Project Description:</b></h3> 
Problem and solution of drunk driving:
"According to 'Or Yarok' association's data, based on the Central Bureau of Statistics, an average of 279 road accidents with casualties happen annually, where the driver was under the influence of alcohol/drugs (data from 2006-2011)."

"2019 data from the Traffic Division shows an astonishing fact: from 2009 to 2019, the police arrested 106,121 drivers for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In focused activities in 2019, 9,774 drivers were caught driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs compared to 9,361 drivers in the previous year â€“ an increase of over 4%" according to an 'Israel Hayom' article.

Moreover, even if you are a responsible driver, how can you know if you have consumed the legal amount of alcohol (A drunk driver is defined as someone driving under the influence of alcohol or an intoxicating drug, with a concentration of alcohol in their body of 240 micrograms of alcohol per liter of exhaled air or more, or 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood in a drunkenness or blood test)?

Therefore, these drivers not only endanger themselves but also other road users. Hence, a solution is needed to prevent these drivers from getting into a vehicle and starting a journey. As a result, the Safe Driving system will prevent a drunk driver from starting any vehicle and thus endangering everyone.

The main goal of the Safe Driving system is to reduce the number of drivers driving under the influence, thus removing dangerous people from the road and saving lives.

  <h3><b>How the System Works:</b></h3>
The system works like a car immobilizer.
1.	The driver presses a button.
2.	The driver blows into a sensor that checks the alcohol level.
3.	If the alcohol level is normal, the immobilizer can be deactivated (if present), and the vehicle can be started for a safe journey to the destination. Otherwise, if the blood alcohol level is higher than the legal limit:
   - If the blood alcohol level is close to the legal limit, the system will ask to wait for some time and then restart the process.
   - If the blood alcohol level is significantly higher than the legal limit, the system will send an SMS message to a predefined backup contact, including the vehicle's GPS location, the driver's blood alcohol level, and the risk involved.
 <h3><b>Technologies and Work Environment:</b></h3>
The system will use:
<br>
Alcohol level sensor<br>
GPS sensor
<br>
Push button<br>
Screen<br>
Telephony system with a SIM card that sends SMS to a predefined backup contact<br>
The system will operate on Linux (e.g., Raspberry Pi) or<br>
an embedded system (e.g., Arduino)
